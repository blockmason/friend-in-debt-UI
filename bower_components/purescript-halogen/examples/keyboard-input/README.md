## Keyboard input example

This example illustrates how to selectively capture keyboard events.

### Building

From the root of the Halogen project:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run example-keyboard-input
```

Or from the current directory:

```
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ npm run build
```

The code will be built as `example.js` in the
`examples/keyboard-input/dist` directory within the example, runnable by
opening the corresponding `index.html`.
