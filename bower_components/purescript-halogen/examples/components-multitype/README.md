## Multi-child component example

This example illustrates a parent component with multiple types of child component.

### Building

From the root of the Halogen project:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run example-components-multitype
```

Or from the current directory:

```
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ npm run build
```

The code will be built as `example.js` in the `examples-components-multitype/dist` directory within the example, runnable by opening the corresponding `index.html`.
