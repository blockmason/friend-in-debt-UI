## Basic example

A super simple button component. It's unlikely something this simple would deserve its own component in a real app!

### Building

From the root of the Halogen project:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run example-basic
```

Or from the current directory:

```
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ npm run build
```

The code will be built as `example.js` in the `examples/basic/dist` directory within the example, runnable by opening the corresponding `index.html`.
